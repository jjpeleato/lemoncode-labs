# Module 1 - Basic Laboratory - Exercise 3

Create the navigation bar from the image using Flexbox.

The HTML is completely open, which means you can create any structures you consider necessary.

The navigation bar adapts to different screen resolutions. Use media queries to achieve this result.

## Installation to develop

   ```bash
   cd labs-module-1-layout/lab-basic/exercise-3
