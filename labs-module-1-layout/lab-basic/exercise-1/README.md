# Module 1 - Basic Laboratory - Exercise 1

Create a dynamic color palette.

Use the SASS language to create different color palette themes.

The idea is to start from a base color and generate four darker colors gradually, and four lighter colors gradually.

To check that everything is working as expected, use the HTML from the instructions (see PDF).

## Installation to develop

1. Install the Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd labs-module-1-layout/lab-basic/exercise-1
   npm i --save-dev
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. If you want to validate the SASS code according Stylelint standard only, run:
   ```bash
   npm run lint:scss
   ```
4. End and happy coding!
