# Module 1 - Basic Laboratory - Exercise 2

Create two different themes and show the results on a page.

The changes in the theme affect the following features:

- Color
- Font
- Border Radius
- Shadow Box

To see the changes, it should be enough to import one theme or another in the main style file.

   ```bash
   cd labs-module-1-layout/lab-basic/exercise-2
