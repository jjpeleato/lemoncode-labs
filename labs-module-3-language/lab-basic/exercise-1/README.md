# Module 3 - Basic Laboratory - Exercise 1 - Array operations

This exercise implements four immutable array operations: `head` (first element), `tail` (all except first), `init` (all except last), and `last` (last element). Each function uses different JavaScript techniques like destructuring, rest operator, and Array.prototype methods.

### Head

Implement an immutable `head` function that extracts and returns the first element from an array using destructuring.

```js
const head = (/* array */) => {}; // Implementation here.
```

### Tail

Implement an immutable `tail` function that returns all elements except the first one from an array. Use the rest operator.

```js
const tail = (/* array */) => {}; // Implementation here.
```

### Init

Implement an immutable `init` function that returns all elements except the last one from an array. Use `Array.prototype` methods.

```js
const init = (/* array */) => {}; // Implementation here.
```

### Last

Implement an immutable `last` function that returns the last element from an array.

```js
const last = (/* array */) => {}; // Implementation here.
```
